# I'm Freddy Danilo ðŸ‘‹
## Front-end Developer

I'm a qualified front-end developer with experience in React Js, Next Js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React Native and much more.

I had my first contact with programming in 2017, creating games with Unity 3D (C#) when I was 16 years old.

In 2020, I decided to start with my YouTube channel about programming to share my knowledge and record my evolution.

Professionally, I have experience in blogs and e-commerce, having led projects focused on SEO optimization and app loading times, which resulted in a significant increase in organic traffic and the achievement of prominent positions in search engines.

I took part in a challenging project that required the development of a multilingual website to serve a global audience. I was responsible for implementing a scalable architecture, integrating automatic translation systems.
