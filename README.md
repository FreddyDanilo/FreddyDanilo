# I'm Freddy Danilo ðŸ‘‹
## Front-end Developer
<p>
 I'm a qualified front-end developer with experience in React Js, Next Js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React Native and much more.

<p>
I had my first contact with programming in 2017 building games with Unity 3D (C#) when I was 16 years old.

<p>
In 2020 I decided to create my Channel on Youtube about coding to share my knowledge and record my evolution.
